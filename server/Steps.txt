ðŸŽ¯ Option 1 â€” Make your testimonials look nice
Add CSS or Tailwind for a clean, modern look.
Create a reusable card component for each testimonial.
Make it responsive for mobile and desktop.

ðŸŽ¯ Option 2 â€” Add more sections
Build more React components:
âœ… About Me â€” who you are, your mission.
âœ… Projects â€” showcase your work (connect to a new API route if you want to pull them dynamically!).
âœ… Skills â€” show your stack (icons, percentages, etc.).
âœ… Contact Form â€” let people send you messages (save to your DB or send to your email).

ðŸŽ¯ Option 3 â€” Host it!
When your frontend and backend are ready:
Deploy your backend API to Render, Railway, or another Node host.
Deploy your React site to Netlify or Vercel.
Connect your custom domain name.
