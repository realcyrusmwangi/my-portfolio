1. Go to the folder
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\my-portfolio

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2. Make sure the repo is ready (safe to run even if already initialized)

git init

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
3. Stage everything

git add .

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
4. Commit

git commit -m "Update: push current local project"


If it says “nothing to commit,” go to step 5.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
5 Push to GitHub

git push origin main

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
6. If step 5 is rejected with “fetch first,” do this, then push again:

git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
7. If you want to replace what’s on GitHub with exactly what you have locally (overwrite):

git push origin main --force


That’s it—just follow 1 → 5 each time you’ve made changes. Use step 6 only if you get a rejection, and step 7 only when you intentionally want to overwrite the remote.
